JSON For 9702
Categorise all the pdf file except 9478_y26_sy.pdf, which consists of physics questions based on the syllabus file 9478_y26_sy.pdf. 
The output of the categorization is to be displayed as a Single-row data JSON file with multiple fields. Start the JSON file with '['.
The first field is "filename" whose value is the pdf filename. 
The second field is "year" whose value is the text between the 1st underscore and second underscore of the filename. 
The third field is "paper" whose value is the text between the third underscore and fourth underscore of the filename.

The fifth field is "mainTopic" whose value is the topic category of the question, the topic category is obtained from the file 9478_y26.pdf where the topic category is identified by the bold character 1 to 20. E.g. 1 Quantities and Measurement, .. 20 Nuclear Physics. 
The sixth field is "otherTopics" whose values consist of other topic categories, if any, also covered by this question. If more than one other topic is found, separate them by a comma. 
After the closing "}," insert a character return to start a new line.
Only use the categories from 9478_y26.pdf, including the leading numerical character. Do not create your own categories. 
Do not need to make reference to the pdf document in the output document. 
Leave the column blank if no category fits. E.g. of JSON format is shown here:
[ {"filename":"9702_m24_qp_22_q1.pdf","year":"m24","paper":"22","question":"q1","mainTopic":"1 Quantities and Measurement","otherTopics":["10 Wave Motion","4 Energy and Fields"]},
